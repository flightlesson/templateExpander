Inspired by an application that used templates like

       "cp {files} {dest-dir}"

where {files} is replaced with the appropriate space-seperated list of
files and {dest-dir} with the appropriate destination directory, this
is a utility for expanding such templates.

Templates have zero or more replaceables -- things like {files} and {dest-dir}.

Replaceables can be more complex: {word|uppercase} gets replaced with
the value of word, converted to uppercase. So if word's value is
elephant, {word|upperase} gets replaced with ELEPHANT. Here, uppercase is a
transformation.

Transformations can take arguments. {word|tr:[a-zA-Z]:[n-za-mN-ZA-M]}
gets replaced with ryrcunag. Here, the tr transformation's two
arguments are [a-zA-Z] and [n-za-mN-ZA-M].
